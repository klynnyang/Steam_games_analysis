# Steam Web API Data Analysis
The goal of this project was to download data from Steam, a PC gaming platform and distributor, to examine ongoing trends with its current library of games (price, rating, developers, publishers).

The data extracted through Steam's Web API can be found here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/slf588mv3q4j5ir/steam_app_data.csv?dl=0
The CSV was too large to be uploaded onto GitHub.

The method used to extracted the data from Steam can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/nikdavis/steam-store-games
Only the data extraction method was used from the original author.

The extracted raw data was cleaned extensively to allow in-depth analysis. Various visualizations were used to demonstrate trends and patterns of the data. See comments for details.
